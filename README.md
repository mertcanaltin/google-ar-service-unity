# About AR Foundation

AR Foundation allows you to work with augmented reality platforms in a multi-platform way within Unity.

AR Foundation is a set of  `MonoBehaviour`s and APIs for dealing with devices that support following concepts:

-   World tracking: track the device's position and orientation in physical space.
-   Plane detection: detect horizontal and vertical surfaces.
-   Point clouds, also known as feature points.
-   Reference points: an arbitrary position and orientation that the device tracks.
-   Light estimation: estimates for average color temperature and brightness in physical space.
-   Environment probes: a means for generating a cube map to represent a particular area of the physical environment.
-   Face tracking: detect and track human faces.
-   Image tracking: detect and track 2D images.
